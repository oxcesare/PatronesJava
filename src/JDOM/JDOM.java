 * JDOM is an open source, java based library to parse XML document and it is typically java developer friendly API. 
 * It is java optimized, it uses java collection like List and Arrays. It works with DOM and SAX APIs and combines the best of the two. 
 * It is of low memory footprint and is nearly as fast as SAX.
 * 
 * Esta libreria permite crear, modificar, eliminar y a√±adir elementos a un archivo XML
